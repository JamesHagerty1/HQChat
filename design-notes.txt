Design Notes

- Using Vue.js because it is widely adopted and provides the best developer
  experience for working on non-trivial frontends.

- Using an Express.js backend because, as a solo developer, using one language
  will make things a lot easier. Also prefer not to use a framework because I
  like feeling in control of my code. Developer happiness, pretty much.

- Also not using TypeScript because using vanilla JavaScript will make
  prototyping easier. And TypeScript is ugly and provides a questionable
  developer experience. Developer happiness, pretty much.

- Using all vanilla JavaScript also means I can reduce the cognitive overhead
  of using various tools while prototyping a richly featured app (in its
  entirety) for the first time. Will make it easier to learn the important
  stuff, not less important things like tooling.
